Image files for graphics go here. Image files for figures go in the "figures" directory. Only place in here images not used in figures (e.g., as parts of tables, as logos, etc.)

Each graphic is a separate file with the naming convention:

"GRPn.xxx" where "n" is a sequential number with leading zeroes appropriate for the total number of graphics and "xxx" is the appropriate extension for the file type.
